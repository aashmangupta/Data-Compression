# Data-Compression

1.	In this project I'm basically trying to implement a data compression algorithm.

2.	In Version 1.0 I'm only going to be able to parse through letters(a-z), but I intend to add other characters
	later on.

3.	The changes in Version 1.1:
		-Uncompression finally works.
		-Added a random.c program that can generate a randomized data file, which can then be used to test my
		compression and decompression software.

## Compile Instructions ##

* To compile compressionAlg run: run gcc compressionAlg.c huffmanTree.c
* To compile uncompress run: gcc uncompress.c
